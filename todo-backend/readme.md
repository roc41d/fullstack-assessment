Note on Submission
During the course of this assessment, I encountered compatibility issues related to my local Node.js environment that impacted my ability to complete the project within the expected time frame. I ultimately had only about half of the allotted time to work on the solution.

Despite these challenges, I pushed forward and structured the project with production readiness in mind â€” using TypeScript, input validation, error handling, modular folder organization, and tests.

If possible, I would appreciate the opportunity to retake or complete the assessment under normal conditions.

Thank you for your understanding.
